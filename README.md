# Jump-Cancel-Grab-
A simple script written using Global OPFF to allow characters to cancel their jump squat by inputting grab to, well, grab, more specifically standing grab, similar to Melee/PM/4xM. Worked in testing, and so far haven't had any issues. If there is anything wrong with the script don't hesitate to message me!
